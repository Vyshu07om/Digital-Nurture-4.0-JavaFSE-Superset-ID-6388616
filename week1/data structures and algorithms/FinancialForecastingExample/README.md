## What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

### Key Components of Recursion

1. **Base Case**: The stopping condition that prevents infinite recursion
2. **Recursive Case**: The part where the function calls itself
3. **Recursive Step**: The problem is broken down into smaller subproblems

### How Recursion Simplifies Problems

- Complex problems become easier to understand
- Code becomes more readable and maintainable
- Natural fit for problems with recursive structure
- Reduces code duplication

## Implementation Details

### Financial Data Class
- **`FinancialData.java`**: Represents financial data points with date, value, and growth rate
- Supports date formatting and growth factor calculations
- Provides utility methods for financial calculations

### Recursive Forecasting Algorithms
- **`RecursiveForecasting.java`**: Implements multiple recursive approaches
- **Basic Recursion**: O(2^n) time complexity, simple implementation
- **Optimized Recursion**: O(n) time complexity using memoization
- **Historical Data Forecasting**: Uses average growth rates from past data
- **Variable Growth Rates**: Supports different rates for each period
- **Target Period Finding**: Calculates periods needed to reach target value

### Algorithm Analysis
- **`RecursionAnalysis.java`**: Comprehensive analysis of recursive algorithms
- Explains recursion concepts and benefits
- Compares basic vs optimized approaches
- Provides optimization techniques and recommendations

## Algorithm Complexity Analysis

### Basic Recursive Algorithm
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n) - Exponential
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Linear (stack space)
- **Advantages**: Simple, intuitive, easy to understand
- **Disadvantages**: Exponential time, stack overflow risk, inefficient

### Optimized Recursive Algorithm (Memoization)
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - Linear
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - Linear (cache + stack space)
- **Advantages**: Dramatic performance improvement, production-ready
- **Disadvantages**: Additional memory usage, more complex implementation

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Suitability |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Basic Recursion | O(2^n) | O(n) | Learning |
| Optimized Recursion | O(n) | O(n) | Production |
| Iterative | O(n) | O(1) | Production |

### Practical Examples (n = 30 periods)
- **Basic Recursion**: ~1 billion operations (2^30)
- **Optimized Recursion**: 30 operations
- **Speedup**: ~33 million times faster!

## Optimization Techniques

### 1. Memoization (Top-Down Dynamic Programming)
- Cache results of expensive function calls
- Check cache before computing
- Store results after computing
- Reduces time complexity from O(2^n) to O(n)

### 2. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming)
- Build results iteratively from base cases
- Fill a table with all subproblem solutions
- Avoid recursion entirely
- Often more space-efficient

### 3. Tail Recursion Optimization
- Ensure recursive call is the last operation
- Compiler can optimize to iteration
- Reduces stack space usage
- Prevents stack overflow

### 4. Cache Management
- Clear cache periodically to prevent memory issues
- Use LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
- Monitor cache size and performance
- Balance memory usage vs performance

## Financial Forecasting Features
